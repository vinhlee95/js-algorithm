# Linked list

## Performance analysis
- push: O(1)
- append: O(1)
- insertAfter: O(1)
- node(index): O(i) where i is the given index
- pop: O(1)
- removeLast: O(n)
- removeAfter> O(1)

## Note
- Linked lists are linear an unidirectional. As soon as you remove a reference from one node to another, you can't go back
- Linked lists have a O(1) time complexity for head first insertions. Arrays have O(n) time complexity for head-first insertions
