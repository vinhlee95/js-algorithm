# Linked list

## Single linked list
Each node has **1 pointer** `next` to link to the next node

## Double linked list
Each node has **2 pointers**: `next` and `prev` to link to the next and previous node

## Which type to use?
Doubly linked lists should be used over singly linked lists when bidirectional traversal/ **search** is required

## Time complexity
### Constant - O(1)
* Add a node
* Delete a node

### Linear - O(n)
* Search for a node
