# Search

## Linear search - O(n)
* Loop through the list to find desired item
* Can be used in either sorted or non-sorted list
* High time complexity compared to **binary search**

## Binary search - O(log n)
* Can be used *only* with sorted list
* Faster than **linear search**
* Length of search list gets divided by half *in every iteration*
